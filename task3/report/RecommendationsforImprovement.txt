1. Implement Hybrid Encryption
Our testing demonstrated that hybrid encryption effectively addresses RSA's limitations:
Implementation Recommendation:

Use RSA exclusively for encrypting a randomly generated symmetric key (AES-256)
Use the symmetric key for actual data encryption
Transmit both the RSA-encrypted symmetric key and the symmetrically encrypted data

Justification:

Our tests showed a 1420-byte message required only 0.000463s for encryption and 0.001027s for decryption
This overcomes the 190-byte size limitation while maintaining security
The performance impact scales linearly with data size rather than exponentially

Implementation Considerations:

Use a cryptographically secure random number generator for the symmetric key
Implement proper key rotation policies
Consider using authenticated encryption modes (like AES-GCM) for the symmetric portion

2. Optimize Key Size Selection
Recommendation:

For general applications: 2048-bit RSA keys (current standard)
For sensitive information: 3072-bit keys
For long-term security (10+ years): 4096-bit keys

Justification:

Our performance testing showed acceptable performance with 2048-bit keys
Each doubling of key length approximately quadruples computational requirements
Key generation time increases substantially with larger key sizes

Implementation Considerations:

Balance security requirements against performance needs
Implement automated key rotation based on defined security policies
Consider hardware acceleration for environments using larger keys

3. Implement Secure Padding
Recommendation:

Always use OAEP (Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding) with a secure hash function
For our implementation, SHA-256 provides an appropriate security level

Justification:

Without proper padding, RSA is vulnerable to multiple attacks including:

Chosen-ciphertext attacks
Padding oracle attacks
Mathematical attacks exploiting RSA's properties



Implementation Considerations:

Ensure consistent padding implementation across all system components
Follow standards precisely (e.g., PKCS#1 v2.1 or higher)
Consider the padding overhead when calculating maximum message sizes

4. Consider Alternative Cryptographic Approaches
Recommendation:

Evaluate Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) as an alternative to RSA
Consider post-quantum cryptography algorithms for future-proofing

Justification:

ECC provides equivalent security with significantly smaller keys:

256-bit ECC â‰ˆ 3072-bit RSA
Smaller keys mean faster operations and lower resource usage


Post-quantum algorithms are resistant to quantum computing attacks

Implementation Considerations:

Ensure broad compatibility when implementing alternatives
Consider hybrid implementations during transition periods
Evaluate the maturity and standardization status of alternatives

5. Implement Secure Random Number Generation
Recommendation:

Use cryptographically secure random number generators for all key generation
Ensure sufficient entropy during the generation process

Justification:

RSA security depends critically on the quality of randomness in key generation
Predictable or weak random numbers have led to numerous real-world vulnerabilities

Implementation Considerations:

Use platform-specific secure random number generators (e.g., /dev/urandom, CryptGenRandom)
Consider hardware random number generators for critical applications
Implement proper entropy estimation and collection

6. Consider Chunking for Special Cases
Recommendation:

When hybrid encryption cannot be used, implement chunking to handle larger messages

Justification:

Our tests showed the maximum message size for 2048-bit RSA is approximately 190 bytes
Chunking allows processing of larger data by breaking it into RSA-compatible blocks

Implementation Considerations:

Implement secure block chaining to prevent block reordering attacks
Include proper authentication to verify message integrity
Consider the overhead of managing multiple encryption/decryption operations
