1. "Not all students passed all subjects"
Negation transforms ∀s: is_passing(s) into ∃s: ¬is_passing(s), meaning "There exists at least one student who failed at least one subject." This shifts from requiring universal success to identifying the existence of any failure.
2. "Not all students have a math score higher than 3"
Negation transforms ∀s: math_score(s) > 3 into ∃s: math_score(s) ≤ 3, meaning "There exists at least one student whose math score is 3 or below." This identifies the presence of very low math performers.
3. "There does not exist a student who scored above 9 in math"
Negation transforms ∃s: is_high_math(s) into ∀s: ¬is_high_math(s), meaning "All students scored 9 or below in math." This changes from seeking excellence to confirming its absence.
4. "There does not exist a student who improved in CS over Math"
Negation transforms ∃s: improved_in_cs(s) into ∀s: ¬improved_in_cs(s), meaning "For all students, CS scores are equal to or lower than math scores." This describes a consistent pattern where math performance equals or exceeds CS performance.
5. "It is not the case that for every student, there exists a subject in which they scored above 6"
Negation transforms ∀s: ∃c: score(s,c) > 6 into ∃s: ∀c: score(s,c) ≤ 6, meaning "There exists at least one student who scored 6 or below in all subjects." This identifies the presence of generally struggling students.
6. "It is not the case that for every student scoring below 6 in Math, there exists a subject where they scored above 6"
This complex negation transforms ∀s: (math_score(s) < 6) → (∃c: score(s,c) > 6) into ∃s: (math_score(s) < 6) ∧ (∀c: score(s,c) ≤ 6), meaning "There exists at least one math-struggling student who also struggles in all other subjects." This identifies the presence of comprehensively struggling students.
