If "All students passed all subjects" is true, your dataset represents a high-performing group with no failing grades.
If "There exists a student who scored above 9 in math" is true, your dataset includes at least some mathematically gifted students.
The evaluation of "For every student scoring below 6 in Math, there exists a subject where they scored above 6" will reveal whether math struggles predict overall academic difficulties or if students tend to have compensating strengths.
If most negations are false, your dataset likely shows consistent patterns; if many are true, there is significant variation among students.
