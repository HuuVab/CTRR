Theory of Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) and Basic Logic
Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)
Reverse Polish Notation, also known as postfix notation, is a mathematical notation in which operators follow their operands. Unlike infix notation (which we commonly use), RPN eliminates the need for parentheses by placing operators after the operands they act upon.
Key characteristics of RPN:

Operators appear after their operands rather than between them
No parentheses are needed to indicate order of operations
Evaluation is straightforward using a stack-based algorithm

Examples comparing infix and postfix notation:

Infix: A + B → Postfix: AB+
Infix: (A + B) * C → Postfix: AB+C*
Infix: A + (B * C) → Postfix: ABC*+

Benefits in logical expression evaluation:

Eliminates ambiguity in operator precedence
Simplifies parsing and evaluation
Allows for efficient stack-based evaluation
